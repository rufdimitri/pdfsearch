Features to implement (TODO):
- add cancel button to stop search
- check if cache was updated and only then save it to the file
- change the way words are selected in central-text-area, make it possible to go through list of results using up/down arrows. Currenty it loses focus upon selection.
- Open a file not-only on double-click but also if Enter key was pressed.
- rename cache-file to "cached-data.pdfsearch"
- optimize cache, maybe split it into N-files and load only necessary file / or create 1 file for every cache entry and load it on "on-the-fly" 
- find also similar words, e.g. "category" -> "Kategorie". That have small (1-2 letters) difference. That would help to find words that were not correctly recognized.
